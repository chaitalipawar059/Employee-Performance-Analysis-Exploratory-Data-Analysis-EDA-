# Employee-Performance-Analysis-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Overall, this project provides a structured foundation for understanding employee performance patterns and serves as a basis for future analytical tasks such as prediction modeling, employee segmentation, or HR strategy optimization.

- The dataset includes a mix of numerical and categorical HR variables such as age, department, service length, and training scores.
- Missing data was minimal, with previous_year_rating being the only major column requiring cleaning.
- Employee distribution varies significantly across departments, and gender ratios are not balanced.
- Numerical variables (age, training score, service length) show natural variation, with many employees in early career stages.
- Training scores are generally moderate, with fewer employees achieving exceptionally high results.
- Higher previous-year ratings tend to align with stronger training performance.
- Most feature correlations are weak, indicating diverse and non-linear employee behavior patterns.
- A moderate relationship exists between previous_year_rating and avg_training_score.
- Length of service and number of trainings show little correlation with overall performance.
- Overall, the dataset is clean and well-suited for HR analytics tasks like performance evaluation, promotion analysis, and training impact assessment.
